Question 1: Try combining this query with a WHERE clause to find how many individual dogs completed tests after March 1, 2014 ?
%%sql
select count(distinct dog_guid)
from complete_tests
where created_at > '2014-03-01';


Question 2: To observe the second difference yourself first, count the number of rows in the dogs table using COUNT(*):
%%sql
select count(*)
from complete_tests;


Question 3: Now count the number of rows in the exclude column of the dogs table:
%%sql
select count(exclude)
from dogs;


Question 4: How many distinct dogs have an exclude flag in the dogs table?
%%sql
select count(distinct dog_guid)
from dogs
where exclude=1;


Question 5: What is the average, minimum, and maximum ratings given to "Memory versus Pointing" game? 
%%sql
select test_name,
avg(rating) AS AVG_Rating,
MIN(rating) AS MIN_Rating, 
MAX(rating) AS MAX_Rating
FROM reviews
WHERE test_name="Memory versus Pointing";

Question 6: How would you query how much time it took to complete each test provided in the exam_answers table, in minutes? 
Title the column that represents this data "Duration."
%%sql
select timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time) AS Duration
from exam_answers
limit 200;


Question 7: Include a column for Dog_Guid, start_time, and end_time in your query, and examine the output. Do you notice anything strange?
%%sql
select dog_guid, start_time, end_time, timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time) AS Duration
from exam_answers
limit 200;


Question 8: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete all of the tests in the exam_answers table, 
if you do not exclude any data?
%%sql
select avg(timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time)) AS AVGDuration
from exam_answers;


Question 9: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete the "Treat Warm-Up" test, 
according to the exam_answers table?
%%sql
select avg(timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time)) AS AVGDuration
from exam_answers
where test_name = "Treat Warm-Up";


Question 10: How many possible test names are there in the exam_answers table?
%%sql
select count(distinct test_name) from exam_answers;


Question 11: What is the minimum and maximum value in the Duration column of your query that included the data from the entire table?
%%sql
select min(timestampdiff(minute,start_time,end_time))AS MinDuration,
max(timestampdiff(minute,start_time,end_time))AS MaxDuration
from exam_answers;


Question 12: How many of these negative Duration entries are there?
%%sql
select count(timestampdiff(minute,start_time,end_time))AS Duration
from exam_answers
where timestampdiff(minute,start_time,end_time)<0;


Question 13: How would you query all the columns of all the rows that have negative durations 
so that you could examine whether they share any features that might give you clues about what caused the entry mistake?
%%sql
select *
from exam_answers
where timestampdiff(minute,start_time,end_time)<0;



Question 14: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete all of the tests in the exam_answers table 
when the negative durations are excluded from your calculation ?
%%sql
select avg(timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time)) AS AVGDuration
from exam_answers
where timestampdiff(minute, start_time, end_time)>0;
