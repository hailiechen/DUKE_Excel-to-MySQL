Question 1: How would you select the Dog IDs for the dogs in the Dognition data set that were DNA tested
(these should have a 1 in the dna_tested field of the dogs table)? Try it below:

%%sql
select dog_guid, dna_tested
from dogs
where dna_tested=1;


Question 2: How would you query the User IDs of customers who bought annual subscriptions, 
indicated by a "2" in the membership_type field of the users table?

%%sql
select user_guid
from users
where membership_type=2;


Question 3: How would you query all the data from customers located in the state of North Carolina (abbreviated "NC") or New York (abbreviated "NY")?

%%sql
select * from users
where state in ("NC", "NY");


Question 4: Now that you have seen how datetime data can be used to impose criteria on the data you select, 
how would you select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of Dognition tests completed before October 15, 2015?

%%sql
select dod_guid, created_at
from complete_tests
where created_at<'2015-10-15';


Question 5: How would you select all the User IDs of customers who do not have null values in the State field of their demographic information

%%sql
select user_guid 
from users
where state is not null;


Question 6: How would you retrieve the Dog ID, subcategory_name, and test_name fields, in that order, 
of the first 10 reviews entered in the Reviews table to be submitted in 2014?

%%sql
select dog_guid, subcategory_name, test_name
from reviews
where YEAR(created_at)=2014
limit 10;



Question 7: How would you select all of the User IDs of customers who have female dogs whose breed includes the word "terrier" somewhere in its name?

%%sql
select user_guid, gender, breed
from dogs
where gender='female' and breed like ("%terrier%");



Question 8: How would you select the Dog ID, test name, and subcategory associated 
with each completed test for the first 100 tests entered in October, 2014?
